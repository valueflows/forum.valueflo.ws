# forum.valueflo.ws

This repository serves as open discussion forum for Value Flows.  It contains issues that are not directly related to adding something to the VF specification, but are more conceptual or strategic in nature.  It contains issues that aren't meant to be closed when complete, but might provide useful ongoing information for people.
